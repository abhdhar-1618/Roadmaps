# Q1.-Tell-me-about-yourself!

Ans. This is a general interview question. But since you are sitting for an accounting interview, you must craft an answer highlighting your professional accounting background. Mention your educational journey in finance, your experience (if any) working at an accounting firm, your milestones, and your strengths.

Make a note of how you can answer this question.

First, provide a basic introduction of yourself. Then you can bring in your experience in the field. You can talk about your years of experience working as an accountant for a specific industry and which areas of accounting were your primary focus areas.

If you are applying for a fresher accounting job, you can mention favourite subjects in accounting and how you have gained expertise in them with good marks in your college or certifications you have taken.

It is important for both freshers and experienced to discuss their educational qualifications. Mainly, it helps the recruiter understand the context of your background a little better. Apart from your university degree, having one or two accounting certifications in a specific area can boost your employability.

Discuss your professional milestones. Maybe it was streamlining the company’s budgeting process. Or it could be about preparing extensive reports that everyone in the team could understand clearly.

Along with that, it may also help to discuss which accounting software you may be comfortable using.

Lastly, talk about your career goals and possibly try to show those goals will align with the company.

Sample Answer

“Sure, my name is [Your Name], and I have been working as an accountant for [number of years] with a focus on [mention any specific areas of expertise or industries you have experience in]

I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Accounting from [University Name], where I developed a strong foundation in financial management, auditing, and taxation. Additionally, I hold [certification name], which demonstrates my commitment to staying up-to-date with industry best practices.

In my previous role at [Company Name], I was responsible for managing the financial statements and preparing detailed reports for executive review. I also played a crucial role in streamlining the company’s budgeting process, resulting in a 20% reduction in overhead costs. Prior to that, I worked at [Company Name], where I gained extensive experience in conducting internal audits and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.

I possess a strong analytical mindset and exceptional attention to detail, which enable me to identify discrepancies and resolve financial issues efficiently. I am proficient in using accounting software like [software names], and I have a solid understanding of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

In the long term, I aim to further develop my financial analysis expertise and eventually progress into a managerial role. I am particularly excited about the opportunity to join your esteemed organisation, as I believe it would provide me with the right platform to contribute my skills and continue growing as an accounting professional.”

# Q2.-What-are-the-different-types-of-accounting?

Ans. Different types of accounting are –

Financial Accounting – This branch of accounting records, summarises and reports the business transactions that take place over a time period in an organisation. It is required in both the private and public sectors.

Administrative Accounting – Administrative accounting is focused on the administrative aspects of the company and is used above all to assess the fulfilment of the established objectives and improve the implemented strategy. It is very useful for making forecasts and planning the actions and resources to be used.

Tax Accounting -Tax accounting helps to register and prepare reports related to tax returns to the public treasury and payment of taxes.

Cost Accounting – This type of accounting is more focused on companies of an industrial nature. It helps to make a detailed analysis of the unit costs of production, sales, and, in general, the production process that the company carries out.

Management Accounting – Management accounting has a broader vision than cost accounting since it records all the economic and financial information of the company to be able to make short-term and long-term decisions.

These resources owned by the company are the cash, the portfolio of financial products, and other investments made by the company.

# Q5.-Give-a-suggestion-to-improve-the-company’s-working-capital-flow.

Ans. In my opinion, the stock on hand can be the key to improving the working capital of the company. Of all the components of working capital, the stock is something we can control. We can pressure our debtors to pay us instantly, but we cannot have direct control over them because they are separate legal entities and, in the end, they are the ones who give us business.

We may tend to delay payments from our suppliers, but it ruins business relationships and hinders goodwill in the industry. Also, if we delay payments, they may not supply goods in the future. Maintaining liquidity in the form of funds in the bank can help the flow of working capital, but it comes at an opportunity cost.

With all of this in mind, I personally believe that inventory management can be of great help in improving the working capital of the company. Over-stock should be avoided and stock turnover rates should be high.

This is one of the generic interview questions for accounts professionals. It is also important from the point of view of B.Com interview questions. There are industries that work with negative working capital, such as electronic commerce, telecommunications, etc. So do some research on working capital before answering.

Q7. Since you mentioned that MS Excel is your favourite, please give us three cases where Excel will make your life easier.

Ans. This is a common accounting interview question.

While MS Excel has many advantages, it is easy to miss the main points regarding its use with company finances.

So, before answering, consider the following tips.

Focus on how Excel can streamline processes, save time, and improve accuracy in the accounting context.

Discuss practical examples demonstrating how Excel has made a difference in your previous accounting work or how it can enhance specific accounting tasks.

Do not forget to mention formulas, data manipulation, and customisability.

Sample Answer

“As an accounting professional, I find MS Excel an indispensable tool for streamlining various tasks. Here are three cases I can think of.

Financial Data Analysis

Excel’s powerful data analysis tools, such as pivot tables and charts, simplify organising and interpreting financial data. With pivot tables, I can quickly summarise large sets of financial information, generate reports, and gain valuable insights into the company’s financial performance.

Excel also has good charting capabilities that enable me to present data visually.  Because of that, stakeholders have been able to understand complex financial trends and patterns.

Budgeting and Forecasting

Creating budgets and forecasts is a fundamental aspect of accounting. I can perform complex calculations and projections using Excel’s built-in formulas and functions. For example, spreadsheets make it easy to calculate NPV (Net Present Value), IRR (Internal Rate of Return), etc.

Excel’s flexibility also allows me to adapt the budget as circumstances change. It ensures that financial planning remains accurate and up-to-date.

Financial Reporting Automation

Excel’s automation features help me save considerable time in generating financial reports. I can input new data through predefined formulas and Excel will automatically update the entire report accordingly. This automation minimises the risk of manual errors and ensures that reports are consistently formatted and accurate. I also like the ability to link data from other sources, such as accounting software or databases, further streamlines the reporting process.

Q8. What is TDS? Where do you show TDS on a balance sheet?

Ans. TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) is a concept aimed at collecting tax at every source of income. In a balance sheet, it is shown in the assets section, right after the head current asset.

Here are some important tips to consider while answering this accounting interview question.

Give an example of how money is deducted at the source.

Briefly explain the implication of TDS.

Discuss why TDS does not show on the balance sheet itself. For example, the TDS amount that is withheld from various payments is recorded as a current liability until it is paid to the government. This is done to ensure that the company segregates the TDS amount and fulfils its obligation of remitting it to the government promptly. Once the TDS is paid to the government, it is no longer recorded as a liability on the balance sheet.

Sample Answer

“A person liable to make specified payments to another person must deduct tax at source and remit it to the Central Government. The deductee, from whose income TDS has been deducted, can claim the credit based on Form 26AS or the TDS certificate issued by the deductor.

TDS rates are specified in the relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act or the First Schedule to the Finance Act. For payments to non-resident individuals, rates specified under Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAA) are considered.

Let’s consider a scenario where a company in India pays its employee a monthly salary of ₹50,000, and the applicable TDS rate for salary payments is 10%. The company is required to deduct TDS from the salary and remit it to the Indian government on behalf of the employee.

Calculation of TDS:

Salary Amount: ₹50,000

TDS Rate: 10%

TDS Amount: ₹5,000 (10% of ₹50,000)

The company will deduct ₹5,000 as TDS from the employee’s salary and remit this amount to the government. As a result, the employee will receive a net salary of ₹45,000 (₹50,000 – ₹5,000) after TDS deduction.

The TDS amount of ₹5,000 withheld by the company will be reported as a liability on its balance sheet until it is paid to the Indian government. This ensures that the company fulfils its obligation of remitting the TDS amount promptly.

The employee will also receive a TDS certificate (Form 16) from the company as proof of tax deduction. This certificate is important for the employee to file their income tax return and claim credit for the TDS deducted from their salary.”

# Q9.-What-is-the-difference-between-‘accounts-payable-(AP)’-and-‘accounts-receivable-(AR)’?

Ans. For this basic accounts payable interview question, you can refer to the table below.

Accounts Payable             Accounts Receivable

The amount a company owes because it purchased goods or services on credit from a vendor or supplier.          The amount a company has the right to collect because it sold goods or services on credit to a customer.

Accounts payable are liabilities.  Accounts receivable are assets.

# Q10.-What-is-the-difference-between-a-trial-balance-and-a-balance-sheet?

Ans. This is a basic accounting interview question. For the answer, mention that a trial balance is the list of all balances in a ledger account and is used to check the arithmetical accuracy in recording and posting. A balance sheet, on the other hand, is a statement that shows a company’s assets, liabilities, and equity and is used to ascertain its financial position on a particular date.

Sample Answer

“A trial balance and a balance sheet are both essential components of the accounting process, but they serve different purposes and are prepared at different stages of the accounting cycle.

Trial Balance:

A trial balance is a statement that lists all the general ledger accounts with their respective debit and credit balances at the end of an accounting period. Its main purpose is to ensure that the total debits equal the total credits, which helps in detecting errors or discrepancies in the accounting records. The trial balance is typically prepared before the financial statements are finalized, and it serves as an intermediate step in the accounting process.

Balance Sheet:

On the other hand, a balance sheet is one of the primary financial statements that provide a snapshot of a company’s financial position at a specific point in time. It presents the company’s assets, liabilities, and shareholders’ equity. The balance sheet is prepared after all adjusting entries and closing entries have been made to the accounts. It is a reflection of the company’s financial health, as it shows what the company owns (assets), what it owes (liabilities), and the residual interest of the owners (equity).

Differences:

The key difference between a trial balance and a balance sheet lies in their timing, content, and purpose. The trial balance is prepared during the accounting period, mainly to check for accuracy and completeness of the ledger balances, while the balance sheet is prepared at the end of the accounting period to present the company’s financial position. The trial balance includes all ledger accounts and their balances, while the balance sheet consolidates these balances into the respective categories of assets, liabilities, and equity.”

# Q11.-Is-it-possible-for-a-company-to-show-positive-cash-flows-and-still-be-in-grave-trouble?

Ans. Yes, if it shows an unsustainable improvement in working capital and involves a lack of revenue going forward in the pipeline.

In general, when referring to positive cash flows, a company receives more money than spending. But that does not define the financial stability of the company always. There can be uncertain situations even when there are positive cash flows but the company may still not be stable or successful.

Some situations are as follows. 

High Debts – A company may have significant debt. Even if the cash flow is positive, the company may only pay the debts and not invest in growth or operational activities.

Decline in the Future Market – The company’s industry may be going through a change which can be impossible to survive in the long run. The positive cash flows at the moment may be surplus, but that is not a guarantee for the future.

Legal Issues – If a company has fines or lawsuits, positive cash flow will not be of any help. There will be financial repercussions.

Although positive cash flows are a positive indicator, they should be evaluated in conjunction with other factors to determine the overall financial position of a company. Factors such as profitability, debt levels, liquidity, market conditions, and long-term sustainability should be considered to assess a company’s financial health comprehensively. Positive cash flows alone do not guarantee a company’s financial stability, and it is important to analyze the broader financial context to identify any potential risks or challenges.

Q13. What is the difference between inactive and dormant accounts?

Ans. Inactive accounts are closed and are not to be used in the future. Dormant accounts are not currently functional but may be used in the future. This is the basic difference you want to highlight in the accounting interview answer.

Use some of these tips for answering this question.

Mention specific criteria or conditions that must be met for an account to be considered inactive or dormant.

Discuss the implications of having inactive and dormant accounts in the financial records.

Sample Answer

“In accounting, inactive and dormant accounts are two distinct terms used to describe the status of certain accounts, and they have specific characteristics that set them apart.

Inactive Accounts

An inactive account refers to an account that has had no financial transactions or activities over a specific period. But it still remains open and is not officially closed or classified as dormant.

Inactivity in such a case may arise due to various reasons. It could be either that accounts opened were for specific projects and have concluded. Or, accounts that were previously active but have not been used for an extended period.

Dormant Accounts

A dormant account, on the other hand, is an account that has remained inactive for an extended period and has little to no financial activity.

The definition of dormancy may vary depending on local regulations, but it is generally characterised by an account not having any transactions for a considerable duration. In some jurisdictions, specific timeframes, such as 12 months or more, might be used to classify an account as dormant.

Differences

The key difference between inactive and dormant accounts lies in their level of inactivity and the treatment they receive.

Inactive accounts have experienced no activity for a certain period but remain open and may be reactivated with a transaction.

Dormant accounts, on the other hand, are considered more inactive, often for an extended period. They may be subject to specific regulations or procedures set forth by the governing authorities.

Implications

Having both inactive and dormant accounts in the financial records can impact financial reporting and management decisions.

Inactive accounts might clutter the chart of accounts. That affects the financial analysis. Companies should regularly review their accounts and consider closing unnecessary inactive accounts to maintain accurate financial records.

Dormant accounts may require special treatment in accordance with local laws or accounting standards. In some jurisdictions, these accounts might be subject to escheatment, where unclaimed funds are transferred to the state or relevant authority after a certain period of dormancy.

# Q14.-Are-you-familiar-with-the-Accounting-Standards?-How-many-accounting-standards-are-there-in-India?-[Frequently-asked-accounting-interview-question]

Ans. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) recommends the Accounting Standards in India. Known as the Indian Accounting Standards or IND – AS, they come under section 133 of the Companies Act 2013. Accounting Standards keep getting revised. As of the latest update (February 2022) on the ICAI website, there are 29 of them.

While these are the essentials to mention, here are tips to follow.

Mention the extent of your familiarity and any specific standards you have worked with.

If you have experience with the Accounting Standards, highlight any specific standards you have worked with and briefly mention your experience in applying them.

If you are not familiar with them or are unsure about the number of standards in India, it is best to admit that and express your willingness to learn and stay updated on relevant accounting practices.

Sample Answer

“Yes, I am familiar with the Accounting Standards, which are a set of principles and guidelines that govern the preparation and presentation of financial statements. These standards play a crucial role in ensuring consistency and transparency in financial reporting.

As of my last knowledge update, there are 29 accounting standards in India, which are issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). These standards cover various aspects of financial reporting, including revenue recognition, inventory valuation, fixed assets, and presentation of financial statements, among others.

In my previous role, I had the opportunity to work with several of these accounting standards. That was Accounting Standard (AS) 16 – Borrowing Costs, which include interest and other costs related to borrowing funds.”

# Q16.-If-our-organization-has-three-bank-accounts-for-processing-payments,-what-is-the-minimum-number-of-ledgers-it-needs?

Ans. In this case, there is a requirement of three ledgers for each account for proper accounting and reconciliation processes.

For this accounting interview question, here are some tips.

Prepare why the three ledgers are needed as the minimum requirements.

You may briefly describe the meaning of ledger – a book or electronic record that contains individual accounts used to record transactions.

Discuss the types of transactions and accounts that need to be recorded for the three bank accounts.

Sample Answer

“In order to accurately record the transactions related to the three bank accounts for payment processing, the minimum number of ledgers required will depend on the specific types of accounts involved in the organization’s accounting system.

At a minimum, the organization will need three separate ledgers, each dedicated to recording the transactions for one of the bank accounts. For example:

Bank Account 1 Ledger: This ledger will contain accounts related to transactions associated with Bank Account 1. It may include a ‘Cash’ account to record deposits and withdrawals, a ‘Bank Account 1’ account to track the balance, and any other relevant accounts.

Bank Account 2 Ledger: Similarly, this ledger will capture transactions specific to Bank Account 2. It will have accounts like ‘Cash’ for tracking cash movements, a ‘Bank Account 2’ account to monitor the balance, and other relevant accounts.

Bank Account 3 Ledger: The third ledger will focus on transactions involving Bank Account 3. It will encompass accounts such as ‘Cash’ for recording cash transactions, a ‘Bank Account 3’ account to monitor the balance, and any other accounts relevant to this particular bank account.”

# Q17.-What-are-some-of-the-ways-to-estimate-bad-debts?

Ans. Some of the popular ways of estimating bad debts are – the percentage of outstanding accounts, aging analysis, and percentage of credit sales.

Don’t forget to provide good examples for this accounting related question to give your recruiter the idea that you actually know the subject in depth.

Here are some more important aspects to you must remember while answering this question.

Elaborate on how each method works and the rationale behind using it.

Describe the importance of estimating bad debts accurately to reflect a more realistic financial position and facilitate sound decision-making.

Sample Answer

“While there are many other ways to estimate bad debts, here are the ones I know. 

Percentage of Outstanding Accounts Method

The percentage of outstanding accounts method estimates bad debts by applying a predetermined bad debt percentage to the total outstanding accounts receivable balance. This percentage is typically based on historical data or industry standards. The formula used is:

Bad Debts Estimate = Outstanding Accounts Receivable Balance * Bad Debt Percentage

This method considers the entire balance of outstanding accounts, regardless of the age of individual receivables. While it offers a straightforward approach, it assumes a uniform risk of default across all accounts.

Aging Analysis Method

The aging analysis method categorises accounts receivable based on the length of time they have been outstanding. It then applies different bad debt percentages to each age category, reflecting the likelihood of collection for older accounts. The formula used for each category is:

Bad Debts Estimate for an Age Category = Outstanding Receivables in the Category * Bad Debt Percentage for the Category

This method provides a more nuanced estimation, considering the specific age of each receivable. Older accounts are assigned higher bad debt percentages, recognizing the increased risk of non-payment as debts age.

Percentage of Credit Sales Method

The percentage of credit sales method estimates bad debts by applying a predetermined bad debt percentage to the total credit sales made during a specific period. The formula used is:

Bad Debts Estimate = Total Credit Sales * Bad Debt Percentage

This method links the estimation of bad debts to the volume of credit sales, assuming that a certain proportion of credit sales will eventually become uncollectible.”

# Q18.-What-is-deferred-tax-liability?

Ans. Deferred tax liability signifies that a company may pay more tax in the future due to current transactions.

Find some more tips to answer this accounting interview question below.

Just do not end the answer with a basic definition. That should be good to know, but your potential employer may be looking for more.

You can highlight the temporary timing differences that give rise to such liabilities in financial reporting.

Also discuss on how deferred tax liabilities are recognised, measured, and presented in the financial statements.

Sample Answer

“I would describe deferred tax liability as something that represents the income tax obligation that a company is likely to face in the future. This could happen due to temporary differences between the financial accounting treatment and the tax treatment of certain items.

When a company prepares its financial statements, it follows accounting principles and standards that may differ from the rules used by tax authorities for calculating taxable income. These differences give rise to temporary timing discrepancies in recognising revenues, expenses, gains, or losses for financial reporting purposes compared to tax purposes.

Let me also tell you when deferred tax liability arises. It happens when the taxable income calculated for tax purposes is expected to exceed the taxable income reported in the financial statements in future periods.

Now, that represents the amount of additional tax that the company will have to pay in the future when these temporary differences reverse and are ultimately taxed at the applicable tax rates.

Further, I would like to add that the accounting treatment of deferred tax liability involves recognising it on the balance sheet as a liability. It is measured based on the enacted tax rates or tax laws that will be applicable in the periods when the temporary differences are expected to reverse.

When these differences gradually resolve over time, the deferred tax liability decreases. Then the corresponding tax expense is recognised in the income statement.”

[back to top](#back-to-top)          

# Q19.-What-is-a-deferred-tax-asset-and-how-is-the-value-created?

Ans. A deferred tax asset is when the tax amount has been paid or has been carried forward but has still not been recognised in the income statement. The value is created by taking the difference between the book income and the taxable income.

Now this should be the base of your elaborate answer. You can add more value to the answer using these tips.

You could describe how deferred tax assets are created and recognised.

Preferably, talk about accounting treatment and the conditions that allow their recognition.

Sample Answer

“A deferred tax asset represents a potential future tax benefit for a company. It arises due to temporary timing differences between the financial accounting treatment and the tax treatment of certain items. This results in lower taxable income reported for tax purposes when you compare to the income in the financial statements.

The creation of a deferred tax asset is based on the principle of conservatism in accounting. It ensures that a company does not overstate its financial position.

When temporary differences lead to lower taxable income in the current period, the company may not be able to utilise the entire tax benefit immediately.

This can carry forward the excess amount as a deferred tax asset to offset future tax liabilities when these temporary differences reverse and create taxable income.

Coming to, on how the value of a deferred tax asset is created, it happens when the amount of deductible expenses or tax credits exceeds the taxable income reported in the financial statements. This difference represents the future tax benefits that the company will be able to realise. This in turn reduces the company’s future tax burden and enhances its financial position.”

# Q20.-What-is-the-equation-for-Acid-Test-Ratio-in-accounting?

Ans. The equation for Acid-Test Ratio in accounting

Acid-Test Ratio = (Current assets – Inventory) / Current Liabilities

While this may seem as an easy answer, there is a chance of follow-up questions. For that, you can use these tips.

Describe the relevant components of the equation.

Discuss how these components help in measuring a company’s ability to meet its short-term financial obligations.

Provide examples throughout the answer.

Sample Answer

“It is a financial metric used in accounting to evaluate a company’s short-term liquidity and ability to pay off its current liabilities without relying on the sale of inventory. It is also known as Quick Ratio.

Let me define the components of the equation – Acid-Test Ratio = (Current assets – Inventory) / Current Liabilities

Current Assets

These are the company’s assets. They are expected to be converted into cash or used up within the next operating cycle or one year. A few common examples include cash, marketable securities, accounts receivable, and short-term investments.

Inventory

This represents the value of the company’s stock of goods or raw materials that are held for production or resale. Since inventory may not always be quickly converted into cash, it is excluded from the quick assets used in this ratio.

Current Liabilities

These are the company’s short-term obligations that are due within the next operating cycle or one year, whichever is longer. Some examples include accounts payable, short-term debt, and accrued expenses.”

# Q23.-What-is-a-bank-reconciliation-statement?

Ans. A bank reconciliation statement or BRS is a form that allows individuals to compare their personal bank account records to that of the bank. BRS is prepared when the passbook balance differs from the cashbook balance.

Now this is a typical answer. What you should do here is elaborate on it. Follow these tips before moving on to the sample answer.

Explain how a bank reconciliation statement helps identify discrepancies between a company’s accounting records and the bank statement.

You could further describe the steps involved in preparing a bank reconciliation statement and the key components included in the statement.

Sample Answer

“The main purpose of a bank reconciliation statement is to identify and rectify discrepancies between the cash balance shown in the company’s books and the balance reported by the bank. These discrepancies may arise due to various reasons, such as outstanding checks, deposits in transit, bank fees, or errors in recording transactions.

The process of preparing a bank reconciliation statement involves the following.

Obtain the latest bank statement from the financial institution and collect the company’s cash balance as recorded in the general ledger.

Compare each transaction recorded in the bank statement with the corresponding entry in the company’s cash account. Identify any differences or discrepancies.

Outstanding checks, which have been issued but not yet cashed by the recipients, and deposits in transit, which have been made but have not yet been credited by the bank, are the common items causing discrepancies.

Make adjustments for outstanding checks and deposits in transit to reconcile the cash balance between the bank statement and the company’s records.

Account for any bank fees, service charges, or interest earned that may not have been recorded in the company’s books.

After making all necessary adjustments, update the company’s cash balance to match the reconciled amount.

Summarise the adjustments made during the reconciliation process in a formal document known as the bank reconciliation statement.

A bank reconciliation statement is a critical control mechanism for a company’s financial management. It helps ensure the accuracy and integrity of financial records by detecting errors, unauthorised transactions, or fraudulent activities.

Additionally, a properly reconciled bank statement aids in providing a more accurate depiction of the company’s actual cash position, which is crucial for making informed financial decisions and maintaining financial stability.”

“The CMM framework has several interconnected elements which can help in knowing the organisation’s accounting progress.

Maturity Levels: Initial, Managed, Defined Level, Quantitatively Managed Level, Optimising Level.

Key Process Areas: To identify all the related activities cluster that together help achieve a set of goals.

Goals: The goals represent the conditions that must be met for the key process area to be successfully implemented in a lasting and effective manner. The achievement of these goals indicates the organisation’s established capability at that maturity level. The goals define each key process area’s scope, boundaries, and purpose.

Common Features: These features can be classified into five types: commitment to performing, ability to perform, performed activities, measurement and analysis, and verification of implementation.

Key Practices: The key practices outline the fundamental elements of infrastructure and practice that significantly contribute to the successful implementation and institutionalisation of the respective area.

Here are some of the main benefits of CMM.

CMM encourages the establishment of standardised accounting processes and practices. This is to reduce the chances of errors and improve overall consistency.

By identifying inefficiencies in accounting workflows, organisations can streamline processes and achieve higher levels of efficiency in financial operations.

CMM emphasises the importance of robust internal controls, leading to better risk management and increased compliance with accounting standards and regulations.

CMM promotes a culture of continuous improvement, encouraging organisations to regularly assess and optimise their accounting processes to adapt to changing business needs.”

# Q28.-What-is-the-meaning-of-purchase-return-in-accounting?

Ans.As the name suggests, a purchase return is a transaction where the buyer of merchandise, inventory or fixed assets returns these defective or unsatisfactory products back to the seller.

Follow these important tips for answering.

Describe the common scenarios that lead to purchase returns, such as damaged goods, wrong shipments, or overstocking.

Emphasise the role of purchase return in financial transactions.

Mention how purchase returns are recorded in the accounting books and the impact on financial statements.

Sample Answer

“Purchase returns occur in various scenarios. This could happen when the received goods are damaged during transit, not as per the specifications. It could also happen when the buyer is overstocked and needs to return excess inventory. In these situations, the buyer initiates the return process by notifying the seller about the problem and seeking authorisation for the return.

The accounting treatment for purchase returns involves adjusting the financial records to account for the returned goods accurately.

If the purchase return results in a cash refund or a credit note, additional journal entries would be made accordingly.

Purchase return is a critical concept in accounting, as it ensures the accuracy of financial records and reflects the reality of the business’s transactions. Properly accounting for purchase returns helps in maintaining transparency and reliability in financial reporting, which is essential for making informed business decisions and building trust with stakeholders.”

# Q31.-What-are-the-trade-bills?

Ans. These are the bills generated against each transaction. It is a part of the documentation procedure for all types of transactions.

It is important to describe the importance of trade bills in accounting too.

Sample Answer

“Technically, trade bills are defined as essential elements in the field of accounting that represent the credit transactions between businesses for the sale and purchase of goods or services.

Based on my understanding, there are many important benefits.

Trade bills enable businesses to offer credit to customers, promoting sales by allowing them to purchase goods or services with a promise to pay at a later date. This credit facility strengthens customer relationships and enhances sales opportunities.

Trade bills influence a company’s cash flow by representing pending payments from customers and outstanding payments to suppliers. Proper management of trade bills is crucial to maintaining a healthy cash flow and liquidity position.

Trade bills form a part of a company’s working capital management. Efficient management of trade receivables and payables ensures that the company has adequate funds to meet its short-term obligations and invest in business growth.

Accurate accounting and reporting of trade bills are vital for preparing financial statements, such as the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement. These financial reports provide valuable insights into a company’s financial health and performance.”

# Q33.-What-happens-to-the-cash,-which-is-collected-from-the-customers-but-not-recorded-as-revenue?

Ans. It goes into “Deferred Revenue” on the balance sheet as a liability if no revenue has been earned yet.

While this is a very simplistic answer, you can enrich it following these methods.

Address the situation where cash has been collected from customers but not yet recorded as revenue in the accounting records.

You should describe how this unrecorded cash is handled in the accounting process and the implications it may have on financial statements.

Sample Answer

“Let me first describe a scenario.

When cash is collected from customers but not yet recorded as revenue in the accounting records, it creates a situation where there is unrecorded cash inflow in the business.

So how should an accountant fix that?

In such cases, the unrecorded cash is typically considered as “Unearned Revenue” or “Deferred Revenue.” Unearned revenue represents the cash received from customers for goods or services that have not yet been delivered or fully rendered. Instead of recognising this cash as revenue immediately, it is recorded as a liability on the balance sheet.

As the goods or services are delivered, and the revenue can be recognised, the unearned deferred revenue is gradually reduced. Then the corresponding amount is transferred to the revenue account. This process is typically done using adjusting entries at the end of an accounting period.”

# Q34.-How-important-is-documentation-when-it-comes-to-accounting?

# Q36.-What-do-you-mean-by-the-company’s-payable-cycle?

Ans. It is the time required by the company to pay all its account payables.

Apart from this understanding, it is important to define this in the context of financial management, which will be helpful when preparing for ap interview questions.

You could describe the process step-by-step, from invoice processing to supplier payment.

Also discuss the payable cycle in managing the company’s cash flow, working capital, and vendor relationships.

Sample Answer

“The company’s payable cycle refers to the series of activities involved in managing and processing payments to suppliers for goods or services received. It represents the time frame between the acquisition of goods or services and the actual payment made to the suppliers.

Let me also explain how it works.

The payable cycle starts with the company’s purchase of goods or services from suppliers on credit. After receiving the goods or services, the company verifies the accuracy and quality of the delivered items. An invoice is generated by the supplier, indicating the amount owed and the payment terms.

The company then reviews and approves the invoice for payment. Depending on the agreed-upon credit terms, the payment is scheduled for a specific period, such as 30 days or 60 days. During this time, the company’s accounts payable department maintains a record of outstanding payables, keeping track of due dates and ensuring timely payments.

The company’s payable cycle impacts the company’s cash flow by influencing the timing of cash outflows for payments. It also provides valuable data for financial planning and budgeting.”

# Q37.-What-is-Scrap-Value-in-accounting?

Ans. Scrap Value is the residual value of an asset that any asset holds after its estimated lifetime.

So what else should you take care of while answering this basic question on accounting?

Mention the formula to discuss how scrap value is recorded and accounted for in the financial statements.

You could explain the importance of it in financial reporting.

Sample Answer

“Scrap value refers to the estimated worth of an asset at the end of its useful life or after it has been fully depreciated. In accounting, it represents the amount that a company expects to receive from selling or disposing of the asset at the end of its productive life.

I can also tell you how to calculate the scrap value.

The formula for calculating depreciation with scrap value is:

Depreciation Expense = (Initial Cost – Scrap Value) / Useful Life

For example, if you purchase a machine for INR 10,000 with a useful life of 5 years and a scrap value of INR 1,000, the annual depreciation expense would be (10,000 – 1,000) / 5 = INR 1,800 per year.

Scrap value is important in accounting as it affects the calculation of depreciation expense and the subsequent financial reporting. Accurate estimation of scrap value is crucial for determining the actual cost of using the asset over its useful life.

It also helps in making informed decisions about whether to retain or dispose of an asset, considering its potential residual value.”

# Q38.-Which-account-is-responsible-for-interest-payable?

Ans.

The current liabilities section of the balance sheet holds the record of the interest payable.

Now you must enrich the answer in the following ways.

Describe how interest payable arises in company transactions.

Show how interest payable is recorded in the accounting books.

Sample Answer

“Interest payable is the amount of interest that a company owes but has not yet paid to its lenders or creditors. It arises from borrowing money through loans, bonds, or other debt instruments, where the company has an obligation to pay interest to the lender based on the agreed-upon interest rate and payment schedule.

The interest expense is recognised in the income statement when a company incurs interest on its outstanding debt. The balance sheet records the corresponding interest payable as a current liability.

Interest payable, being a current liability, is crucial for financial reporting and assessing the company’s short-term obligations. It is expected to be settled within a relatively short period, usually one year or the operating cycle, whichever is longer. Proper management of interest payable helps evaluate the company’s liquidity and short-term debt obligations. This  influences financial decisions related to cash flow management and working capital.”

# Q52.-Can-you-define-the-term-Material-Facts?

Ans. Yes, these are the documents such as vouchers, bills, debit and credit notes, receipts, etc. They serve as the base of every account book.

Here are some additional tips you should use while discussing your answer.

Mention that this term falls under the materiality convention of accounting. (You could also elaborate on the four conventions of accounting – conservatism, consistency, disclosure, and materiality.)

Give an example explaining what happens when material facts are not stated clearly.

Sample Answer

“Material facts, in the context of accounting and financial reporting, refer to information or events that could significantly influence the economic decisions of users of financial statements.

These facts are deemed “material” only when their omission or misrepresentation would likely affect the judgments or decisions made by stakeholders.

If relevant material information is not disclosed, stakeholders may make uninformed decisions. That would lead to potential financial risks and adverse consequences for both the company and its stakeholders.

Allow me to give an example of the importance of material facts.

Let’s consider a hypothetical scenario involving a publicly traded company, XYZ Inc. The company recently faced a significant product recall due to safety concerns. But, in their financial statements and public disclosures, XYZ Inc. did not clearly state the material facts related to the recall.

Now when it comes to financial reporting, investors and stakeholders may not be aware of the potential financial impact of the recall on the company’s revenue, expenses, and future profitability.

The lack of clear disclosure about the product recall could erode trust in XYZ Inc. among its investors, customers, and other stakeholders.”

Assets – Liabilities = Net Assets.

In this answer,

Describe what is an asset, liabilities, and net assets.

Discuss the reason why net assets are important in a company’s accounting.

Sample Answer

An asset is an economic resource. It is owned or controlled by an individual, organisation, or entity. This has the potential to provide future economic benefits. Overall, they are the valuable resources that a company possesses and can use to generate revenue or provide services.

Some examples of assets are cash, accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant, equipment, patents, trademarks, and investments.

Liabilities represent the claims of creditors against the company’s assets. They reflect the company’s obligations to repay borrowed funds, fulfil contracts, or settle outstanding obligations.

A few examples of liabilities are accounts payable, loans, bonds, and salaries payable.

# Q59.-Where-should-you-record-a-cash-discount-in-a-journal-entry?       

Ans. A cash discount should be recorded in the “Accounts Receivable” or “Accounts Payable” account, depending on whether the company is offering or receiving the discount. Additionally, it should be recorded in a separate “Sales Discounts” or “Purchase Discounts” account to track the discounts separately from the main accounts.

You could also discuss the importance of recording a cash discount. Mention clearly that properly recording cash discounts in journal entries ensures accurate financial reporting and transparency.

Salvage Value – This refers to the asset’s value after the useful value. A business can sell it for a reduced price.

Total Cost of Asset – It is the inclusive cost of taxes, shipping and others.

To support this accounting interview answer, you can highlight how they are calculated.

The formula for Straight Line Depreciation over a year is

Total Cost of Asset – Salvage Value (estimated) / Useful life of an Asset = Depreciation Expense (Annual)

For publicly traded companies, partitioning assists in preparing segment-wise financial reports.

In financial statement preparation, partitioning is used to categorise assets, liabilities, and equity into current and non-current components.

Partitioning cash flows into operating, investing, and financing activities helps assess the company’s cash generation, capital investments, and financial position.

Financial ratios often require partitioning specific financial data to calculate key performance indicators.

# Q67.-What-is-an-over-accrual?               

Ans. It is a situation where the estimate for accrual journal entry is very high, and this may apply to the accrual of revenue or expense.

Some tips to improve this answer and impress your accounting firm recruiter.

Describe how an over-accrual occurs and its impact on financial statements.

Mention the actions taken to rectify an over-accrual and ensure accurate financial reporting.

Sample Answer

“An over-accrual is an accounting error that occurs when a company records an expense or liability in excess of the actual amount that should have been recognised.

This is how an over-accrual occurs.

Over-accruals typically arise due to estimates made by the company to match revenues and expenses accurately. In accrual accounting, expenses are recognised when incurred, regardless of cash payment. If the actual expense turns out to be lower than the estimated accrual, an over-accrual occurs.

To rectify an over-accrual, the company must make adjusting entries in the accounting records. The following steps are typically taken:

The first step is to identify the specific expense or liability that was over-accrued and determine the correct amount.

An adjusting entry is made to reverse the over-accrued amount from the accounts, reducing the expense or liability to the correct amount.

A new entry is made to record the actual expense or liability based on the correct information.”

# Q68.-What-is-reversing-journal-entries?

# Q70.-What-is-a-Bad-debt-expense?       

Ans. Bad debt expense is asset accounts receivable of a company and is considered to be uncollectible accounts expense or doubtful accounts expense.

You can mention more in this accounting interview question.

For example, if there is a follow-up question, you may need to expand on the nature of bad debt expense and the circumstances under which it arises.

The recruiter may also want to know how bad debt expense is exactly recorded in the accounting books, or if it has any impact on financial statements.

Mention in this way, then.

Companies often offer credit to customers, allowing them to purchase goods or services on credit with an agreement to pay later. While most customers pay their dues on time, some may default on their payments for various reasons, such as financial difficulties, bankruptcy, or disputes. The amount deemed uncollectible is recognised as bad debt expense.

The estimated uncollectible amount is recorded as an expense by creating an “Allowance for Doubtful Accounts”. Suppose a specific customer account is confirmed to be uncollectible. In that case, it is written off as a bad debt from both accounts receivable and the “Allowance for Doubtful Accounts” to maintain the accuracy of the accounting records.

Further, the income statement reports bad debt expense as an operating expense, reducing the reported net income. On the balance sheet, the “Allowance for Doubtful Accounts” reduces the accounts receivable, indicating the estimated uncollectible portion.

# Q71.-When-do-you-capitalize-rather-than-expense-a-purchase?

# Q72.-When-does-goodwill-increase?    

Ans. Goodwill can be increased through the acquisition of another company as a subsidiary, by paying more than the fair value of its tangible and intangible assets.

For this accounting interview question, you could further highlight how goodwill is treated in accounting.

Mention that to calculate the goodwill, the acquiring company subtracts the fair value of the target company’s identifiable net assets (tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities) from the purchase price. The resulting excess is recognised as goodwill.

Goodwill is not amortized like other intangible assets but is subject to an annual impairment test to assess its value.

You can also say how goodwill helps measure the company’s value. Investors and stakeholders use goodwill to assess the success of mergers and acquisitions, as it indicates the perceived value of the target company’s intangible assets and potential future growth opportunities.

# Q75.-What-is-the-owner’s-equity?         

Ans. The owner’s equity is a business owner’s claim against the assets of the business. It is also called the capital of the business and is calculated by subtracting the equity of creditors from the total equity.

Owner’s equity is a critical indicator of the financial health and stability of the business. It shows the owner’s financial interest in the company and their stake in the assets.

# Q84.-What-do-you-mean-by-Amortization-and-also-mention-its-journal-entry? 

Ans. Amortization is an accounting concept that is used to gradually write off the cost. Through amortization, over a period of time, one can allocate the cost of any intangible asset. Also, it can be done to repay any loan principal. However, those assets which have an indefinite life like Goodwill can not be amortized.

Also read the difference between depreciation and amortization to explain this answer such accounts basic questions better, providing your overall knowledge of the

Below is the journal entry for amortization:

               Debit     Credit

Amortization expense     x~xx      

Accumulated amortization                          xxx

The concept of amortization in accounting is different from depreciation. The major point of difference between amortization and depreciation is their usage. Amortization works for intangible assets whereas depreciation works for tangible assets. Also, unlike depreciation, amortization has no salvage value. Another key difference between both is that depreciation can be implemented using both the straight-line method and accelerated method but amortization is implemented through the straight-line method.

Using the below transactions solve the practical accounting questions:

# Q85.-What-is-the-total-value-of-cash-in-the-above-transactions?             

Ans. Here is the total calculation of cash:

All Cash Transactions and balances:

Actual Cash = 4,50,000

Salaries payable = 32,000

Company’s car lease = 1,00,000

Office rent = 25,000

CCTV purchase = 20,000

Accounts payable = 30,000

Petty cash = 10,000

Petty cash replenished = 7,000 + 2000

Balance petty cash = 1000

Salaries paid = 30,000

Accounts receivable = 60,000

Ad and marketing expense = 6,000

Utility expense = 5,000

Dividend paid = 15,000

Hence as per the nature, here is the actual calculation of cash:

4,50,000 – 32,000 – 1,00,000 – 25,000 – 20,000 – 30,000 – (10,000 – 1,000) – 1,000 + 60,000 – 5,000 – 15,000 = 2,73,000

Ans. All entries related to accounts receivable:

Accounts receivable = 20,000

Income from selling CCTV camera = 42,000

Billed Fixing services = 10,000

Accounts receivable = 60,000

Hence, here is the total calculation of accounts receivable:

20,000 + 42,000 + 10,000 + 60,000 = 1,32,000

# Q91.-What-do-you-mean-by-Days-Payable-Outstanding-(DPO)?               

Ans. DPO or Days Payable Outstanding refers to the average number of days that ideally a company takes to clear its credit purchase in regards to the outstanding suppliers. Most of the time, DPO is a monthly task for a business, however, each month the day of clearing the outstanding payment might differ, hence the average is taken out to estimate the payment period.

Below is the formula for calculating DPO:

Closing accounts payable / Purchase per day

Or

(Average accounts payable / COGS) X Number of days

[back to top](#back-to-top)          

# Q92.-Find-out-the-DPO-in-the-below-query.      

Ans.

Average accounts payable in June             50,000

Cost of Goods sold in June            5,00,000

As the month of June has 30 days the DPO will be:

(50,000/5,00,000)*30 = 3 days

Hence, the DPO in the above situation is 3 days. This states that a company takes 3 days on average to clear all its pending invoices.

# Q93.-What-are-the-different-types-of-liquidity-ratios-in-accounting?      

Ans. Basically, there are five different types of ratios in accounting:

Current Ratio

The higher the company has current ratio, the better is the company’s strength to handle short-term financial issues. It is calculated by – Current ratio = Current Asset/ Current Liabilities

Net-Working Capital Ratio

It articulates whether or not a company has sufficient funds to carry out short-term operations. It is calculated by – Current Asset – Current Liabilities

Quick ratio

The quick ratio is also known as the acid test ratio or liquid ratio which illustrates the company’s short-term liquidity to meet any short-term obligations. If the quick ratio is below 1:1, the company is not in a good state to handle short-term debts. Quick ratio = Liquid Assets / Current Liabilities

Super-Quick Ratio

Super Quick Ratio = (Cash + Marketable Securities) / Current Liabilities

The operating Cash Flow ratio

It is calculated by dividing cash flow from operations with current liabilities. It is observed that a sound operating cash flow ratio makes the firm’s liquidity position better.

Here cash flow from operations will generally include:

All revenues from operations + Non-cash based expenses – Non-cash based revenue

Whereas Current Liabilities will include:

Balance payments, creditors, provisions, short term loans, etc.

# Q119.-Name-some-common-ways-of-identifying-fraudulent-entries.-     

Ans. With this accounting interview question for senior-level positions, the employer wants to know how attentive the candidate is to journal entries and ledgers. Awareness of different types of fraud behaviours and fraud monitoring/prevention methods are important.  For instance, say,

I know some of the most common fraudulent behaviours such as

Out-of-period revenues are used for recording inflated revenue.

To show earnings, the cost of repairs is used as fixed assets.

Liabilities are not present on the balance sheet.

Sometimes, expenses also can be shown as earnings when they are recategorised as company reserves.

To detect fraud, I follow these preventive measures:

First, I understand the organisation’s financial reporting process.

I also select journal entries for testing.

Interview individuals directly who have been involved in the financial reporting process.

I can multitask without hampering the quality of another project at hand.

I identify repeatable tasks such as sales proposals and client billing and turn them into the standard operating procedure (SOP). So each time I do these, I don’t have to start from scratch.

I use time-tracking apps for each project.

# Q121.-What-exactly-is-double-entry?-How-are-transactions-recorded-in-such-an-accounting-system?        

Ans. This is an example of general accounting interview questions for all levels.

Double entry is one of the oldest accounting systems. It simply means that for every accounting entry there is a corresponding entry into a different account. In this system, all transactions are recorded as credits and debits. This bookkeeping method relies on the fundamental accounting equation –

Assets = Liabilities + Equity of the Shareholder

To explain how it works, you can give this example:

Suppose, ABC Company purchases Rs.5000 worth of office supplies by paying cash upfront. In this case, ABC Company’s asset account is required to increase by Rs.5000, while cash will need to decrease by Rs.5000. The asset account will be debited, while the cash amount will be credited. Here, the debit amount is always equal to the credit amount.

[back to top](#back-to-top)          

# Q122.-Name-at-least-five-different-types-of-accounts-in-double-entry-bookkeeping.-      

Ans. The five main types of accounts used are:

Liability Account – When a company owes money to other businesses and will pay at a later date, it uses a liability account.

Capital Account – A capital account determines the net worth over a specific period, commonly during a year. These accounts include the shareholder’s equity.

Expense Account – This type of account includes a company’s daily operation costs. The costs can be for money spent on advertising or other expenses that are administrative in nature.

Income Account – This account shows what a company has earned over a specific period. It records the sources where the money originates from as well as the revenue gained for the sale of products/services.

Asset Account – It refers to any cash or goods a company owns.

Prepare such accountant interview questions and answers in a way that your answers don’t come across as too brief. Elaborate with real-life situations.

# Q123.-What-differentiates-contingent-liability-from-bad-debts?               

Ans. This accounting interview question is asked to understand whether you are well aware of the difference between very similar concepts.

Contingent liability is not recorded on a balance sheet. It is simply the result of a record that may not occur. On the other hand, bad debt is recorded at the same time when there is a sale.

# Q124.-Why-are-financial-projections-required-in-accounting?    

Ans. This is how you should answer such important account interview questions.

A financial projection is necessary for managing any business, be it, small, medium or large. It shows forecasts on financial estimates including revenues and financial statements’ expenses. It takes into account the analysis of historical data and predicts different factors in the market outside a business.  Typically financial projections include the following:

Income Statement projection – It includes expenses, revenues, total income (Revenue – Expenses), income tax and net income over a particular period.

Cash flow projection – It includes cash revenues and cash disbursements.

Balance Sheet projection – The balance sheet determines a business’s net worth. It includes assets, liabilities and equity.

If you are a senior accountant candidate, support this accounting interview question with the importance of financial projections such as:

With a financial projection, it is convenient for investors to know a business will operate.

A financial projection can predict potential risks in business operations much before.

A business can prepare a clear budget with a financial projection.

# Q125.-What-is-included-in-a-journal-entry?       

Ans. A journal entry can have multiple data elements, as it records every business transaction in the journal ledger or subsidiary ledger. The common elements in a journal entry are divided across five columns in an Excel spreadsheet.

Column 1 has the date of transaction

Column 2 has the record of any business transaction

Column 3 has the folio or reference number

Column 4 has the debit amount

Column 4 has the credit amount

Compound Journal Entry

Adjusting Journal Entry

Opening Journal Entry

Closing Journal Entry

Reversing Journal Entry

Transfer Journal Entry

Try to explain all these types of journal entries with relatable examples.

# Q127.-Explain-a-drawing-account-in-a-journal-entry-and-how-it-differs-from-an-expense-account.              

Ans. A drawing account tracks all the money and assets that are withdrawn from a business. Generally, this money is withdrawn by the owners/proprietors of the business for personal purposes. This account shows the reduction of the money the business has. On the other hand, an expense account records the expense of the business and is not for personal use.

# Q128.-Describe-Cost-Object-with-an-example.  

Ans. A cost object is an item that the business measures separately. The item here refers to a product, department, customer, or anything that costs the business. By calculating cost objects, the business can determine its operational or output-related costs and assess if they are cost-efficient. Cost objects also help in preparing annual reports.

A basic example of a cost object could be a marketing department of a company. The expenses of creating campaigns digitally or offline, staffing requirements, office space and supplies for the marketing team are common. Based on that, the company can set a price strategy for the product that is going to be commercialised.
